# **HORROR TOP TRUMPS**

Based on the popular card game of the late 80s called top trumps.

This game seeks to give a flavour of the game using some basic javascript.
The subject matter is famous horror film villains.

## Early Concept

   * ### Design Ethos
   * The basic design required a simple landing page and a link to the game page
      * I wanted this to have a gothic horror feel in terms of design
      * Midjourney was used to create the graphical elements
      * I wanted the experience to be clear and concise
   * I decided early on to not follow a specific tutorial to build the game. I wanted the experience (for better and worse) of writing something from the ground up. As is detailed below I did use a pre-written randomise function and simply adapted it to the game.
   
   * ## Rough Test Version

   * The above is the first very rough mock up of how the game page might look. 
   * Bold colours were used for test purposes and all code has console logs left in
   * Code comments were left out as it was purely for my own use. It is provided here to show how the concept went from that to what the site ended up with.
   * I felt it important to test the actual concept outside of writing the project for real to see if it was something I could feasibly complete.
   * You will note this version uses more crude methods such as timeouts to progress the game and has a different win condition (among many other changes)

 * ### Typography
 * The fonts chose for the site were
      * Alice from googlefonts - Using the standard embedded code method
      * New Rocker from font squirrel - This required using their onsite webfont generator and uploading the files to my repo
 * Fonts were chosen to keep in line with the gothic horror feel while remaining readable.

-----------------------------------------

 * ### Colors
 * The following general color palette was chosen. I wasn't able to narrow this down to 4 specific colours as heavy detailed raster graphics are used extensively so it felt wrong. But overall the colours used fall into the following general tones.
     * Bone color / yellowy off white
     * Dark black 
     * Reds
 * These were picked to keep in line with the graphical elements and create a washed out dark gothic feeling.

-----------------------------------------

 * ### Coding
 * All code was written from scratch except were explicitly stated below:

   * The splice method was taken from here and adapted for use in my code
     * [Splice method guide](https://thewebdev.info/2022/06/26/how-to-split-array-into-two-arrays-with-javascript/)
 
   * The randomiser code was taken from here and used to shuffle the card array ready for splicing. This was required so that the cards for each player were different each game
     * [Randomiser code](https://javascript.info/task/shuffle)
 
   * The text shadows were created using this code generator 
     * [Text shadow generator](http://owumaro.github.io/text-stroke-generator/)

   * Lessons learned - As the functions and interactions of the game becmae more complex from the test to live version, many errors were introduced relating to calling functions in the correct order. I attempted to keep the code as clear as possible from errors, but as I was learning while doing it there are some areas of code are probably far more complex and less concise than is required.

-----------------------------------------

* ### Development process
* Git Commits - I attempted to commit often especially with the complexity of the JS      
* Code Comments - Comments have been added to all files to make future editing easier
* JS comments - I left fairly verbose comments in to describe the more complex code blocks
* What I'd do differently - More so than the first project I feel this one taught me how complex code become and how adding seemingly small features or ideas can exponentially balloon the complexity of said code out of control. This was a very simply 1 page game, I can see clearer than before how a methodical and clear process would be paramount on a project of any real size.

* ## Deployment

   * The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
   * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
   * From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
   * Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 
      * The live link can be found - [Here](https://jeffreybull76.github.io/CI_Project2/index.html)

* ### Forking the repository
   * A copy of the GitHub Repository can be made by forking the GitHub account. This copy can be viewed and changes can be made to the copy without affecting the original repository. Take the following steps to fork the repository;
   * Log in to GitHub and locate the repository.
   * On the right hand side of the page inline with the repository name is a button called 'Fork', click on the button to create a copy of the original repository in your GitHub Account.

* ### Cloning the repository
   * Under the repoâ€™s name, click on the code tab.
   * In the Clone with HTTPS section, click on the clipboard icon to copy the given URL.
   * In your IDE of choice, open Git Bash.
   * Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
   * Type git clone, and then paste the URL copied from GitHub.
   * Press enter and the local clone will be created.
