## Early Concept

   * ### Design Ethos
   * The basic design required a simple landing page and a link to the game page
      * I wanted this to have a gothic horror feel in terms of design
      * Midjourney was used to create the graphical elements
      * I wanted the experience to be clear and concise

 * ### Typography
 * The fonts chose for the site were
      * Alice from googlefonts
      * New Rocker from font squirrel 
 * Fonts were chosent to keep in line with the gothic horror feel while remaining readable.

-----------------------------------------

 * ### Colors
 * Colours denoting a dark gothic feel were chosen
     * Bone color (various shades)
     * Black 
     * Red 
 * These were picked to keep in line with the graphical elements and create a washed out dark gothic feeling.

 * ### Coding
 * All code was written from scratch except were explicitly stated below:

   * The splice method was taken from here and adapted for use in my code
     * [Splice method guide](https://thewebdev.info/2022/06/26/how-to-split-array-into-two-arrays-with-javascript/)
 
   * The randomiser code was taken from here and used to shuffle the card array ready for splicing. This was required so that the cards for each player were different each game
     * [Randomiser code](https://javascript.info/task/shuffle)
 
   * The text shadows were created using this code generator 
     * [Text shadow generator](http://owumaro.github.io/text-stroke-generator/)

* ### Development process
* Git Commits - I attempted to commit often especially with the complexity of the JS      
* Code Comments - Comments have been added to all files to make future editing easier
* JS comments - I left fairly verbose comments in to describe the more complex code blocks

* ## Deployment

   * The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
   * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
   * From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
   * Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 
      * The live link can be found - [Here](https://jeffreybull76.github.io/CI_Project2/index.html)

* ### Forking the repository
   * A copy of the GitHub Repository can be made by forking the GitHub account. This copy can be viewed and changes can be made to the copy without affecting the original repository. Take the following steps to fork the repository;
   * Log in to GitHub and locate the repository.
   * On the right hand side of the page inline with the repository name is a button called 'Fork', click on the button to create a copy of the original repository in your GitHub Account.

* ### Cloning the repository
   * Under the repoâ€™s name, click on the code tab.
   * In the Clone with HTTPS section, click on the clipboard icon to copy the given URL.
   * In your IDE of choice, open Git Bash.
   * Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
   * Type git clone, and then paste the URL copied from GitHub.
   * Press enter and the local clone will be created.
